TROUBLESHOOTING

Problem: The data in the serial1 DAT is coming in funny (i.e. the readings are running together or skipping lines).

Solution: Make sure that in the TouchDesigner parameters for the serial1 DAT, you have Row/Callback Format set to "One Per Line." Another reason data corruption might happen is if you don't have a significant delay for print / read statements on the Arduino or TouchDesigner end. Try changing the delay between Serial.println() statements in Arduino to be greater than 100 milliseconds. If this is not possible, and you need a very quick read, I recommend sending but not printing the data over Serial. This can be done using the Serial.write() function. You can also send data using OSC, UDP, or TCP / IP.

Problem: TouchDesigner is chugging / the interactivity is delayed.

Solution: Delays might occur if you are trying to process data too quickly or if you have too many visual elements taxing your computer's GPU. Try the changes listed above or making the viewers inactive for your TOPs.

Problem: Arduino isn't recognizing the Teensy as an available board.

Solution: Make sure you that you have Teensyduino installed. If you do, you should see a drop down for Teensy boards under Tools > Boards. If you still don't see your Teensy, press the reset button to see if it needs to be switched from HEX into PROGRAM mode (fun fact: when Teensy boards are shipped, they are generally not in PROGRAM mode and so you will need to do this). If the board still doesn't appear, try unplugging / replugging in your Teensy. If that doesn't work, try a different Micro USB cable (also fun fact: not all micro USB cables are made for data transmission and some might not work with your microcontroller!) As a last resort, try a different Teensy.
